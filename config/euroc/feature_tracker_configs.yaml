min_dist: 30            # min distance between two features 
freq: 10                # frequence (Hz) of publish tracking result. At least 10Hz for good estimation. If set 0, the frequence will be same as raw image 
F_threshold: 1.0        # ransac threshold (pixel)
equalize: true             # if image is too dark or light, trun on equalize to find enough features
fisheye: false              # if using fisheye, trun on it. A circle mask will be loaded to remove edge noisy points
